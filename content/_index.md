## Welcome

Our predecessor, Asia Pacific Neural Network Assembly (APNNA) was founded in 1993, after IJCNN'93 in Nagoya, under the leadership of Professor Shunichi Amari. The mission of APNNA is to promote active interactions among researchers, scientists, and industry professionals who are working in Neural Networks and related fields in the Asia-Pacific region. APNNA had Governing Board Members from 13 countries/regions â€“ Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Qatar, Taiwan, Thailand, and Turkey. The annual conference is the [International Conference of Neural Information Processing](https://wiki.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/APNNANEW/iconip) (ICONIP).

In 2014, APNNA has decided to proceed from an assembly to a member-based society, APNNS, in order to further promote the field in the Asia-Pacific region including the further advancement of ICONIP, with operations most suitable for the vibrant Asia-Pacific region. APNNS also seeks more active participation from researchers and professionals in the region. APNNS was formally established in November 2015.
